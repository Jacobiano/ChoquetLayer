## Abstract

> In this study, we propose a new methodology that leverages the Choquet capacity, a mathematical tool from the theory of capacities, to capture the intricate properties of point patterns. By incorporating a dilation model, we enhance the ability to represent the spatial arrangement and density variations in the Neyman-Scott point process accurately. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, extensive experiments were conducted on synthetic datasets simulating diverse spatial point patterns on cell. The dilation model applied on real data with the distance function. We achieved the accuracy of $90\%$ which out performed CNN. The method is far faster than the other deep learning methods.


## Software implementation

> Briefly describe the software that was written to produce the results of this
> paper.

All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in
the `code` folder.
The calculations and figure generation are all run inside
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
The data used in this study is provided in `data` and the sources for the
manuscript text and figures are in `manuscript`.
Results generated by the code are saved in `results`.
See the `README.md` files in each directory for a full description.


## Getting the code

You can download a copy of all the files in the repository morpholayersby cloning the
[git](https://git-scm.com/) repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Jacobiano/ChoquetLayer.git



## Dependencies
